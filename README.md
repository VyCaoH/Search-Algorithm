# Search-Algorithm
The Search Algorithm is a versatile and comprehensive Python implementation that encompasses popular search algorithms including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* (A-star), and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS). With this algorithm, users can efficiently traverse and explore graphs, trees, or other data structures in search of specific elements or optimal paths. The implementation is easy to understand and use, providing a straightforward interface for incorporating the desired search algorithm into various projects. Whether you need to find the shortest path, explore all possible paths, or prioritize heuristic-based searches, this Python implementation has got you covered.
